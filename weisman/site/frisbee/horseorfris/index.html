			<p>
				Horse names are all historical Kentucky Derby contenders, scraped from Wikipedia.
				Frisbee team names are from the 2017 USAU club season, scraped from the list
				<a href = "http://play.usaultimate.org/teams/events/rankings/">here</a> in summer 2017.
				I personally selected what I thought were the 200 or so least obvious names in each category.
