About me
===========

I'm Teddy, a sixth-year mathematics PhD student at the University of Texas at Austin. Currently my research interests are in geometric structures on manifolds, discrete subgroups of Lie groups, and geometric group theory. My advisor is [Jeff Danciger](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/jdanciger/index.html).

Starting in Fall 2022, I will be an NSF Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Michigan, where my postdoctoral mentor will be [Ralf Spatzier](https://dept.math.lsa.umich.edu/~spatzier/).
