About me
===========

I am a fifth-year mathematics PhD student at the University of Texas at Austin. Currently my research interests are in convex projective structures and geometric group theory. My advisor is [Jeff Danciger](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/jdanciger/index.html).

I graduated with a bachelor's in mathematics from Yale University in 2016.
