I'm interested in studying some of the interaction between geometric group theory and Lie theory. That is, I've been thinking about ways to use ideas in geometric group theory to find and understand interesting discrete subgroups of Lie groups. In particular I'm interested in convex cocompact group representations. These are a nice family of representations of word-hyperbolic groups into rank-one Lie groups, which behave well with respect to both the coarse geometry of the represented group and the smooth geometry of the target group.

I'm especially interested in thinking about possible generalizations of convex cocompactness, for instance Anosov representations, and currently I'm thinking about notions of convex cocompact representations that make sense for groups which are not necessarily word-hyperbolic. At the moment I'm thinking about this in the context of group actions on properly convex domains in projective space.
