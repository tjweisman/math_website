==========

My research is about the interaction between geometric group theory and geometric structures on manifolds. Mainly this means that I use ideas in geometric group theory to understand interesting discrete subgroups of Lie groups. In particular I'm interested in convex cocompact group representations. These are representations of word-hyperbolic groups into rank-one Lie groups which behave well with respect to both the coarse geometry of the represented group and the smooth geometry of the target group.

I'm especially interested in generalizations of convex cocompactness in higher rank, for instance Anosov representations, and currently I am thinking about notions of convex cocompact representations (and Anosov representations) that make sense for groups which are not necessarily word-hyperbolic. Many of the examples I work with come from convex projective structures on manifolds, and are often inspired by hyperbolic geometry.
