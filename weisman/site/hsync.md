# Hulu sync Chrome Extension

## Installation

1. Download the extension as a zip file: [hsync_extension.zip](resources/hsync_extension.zip)

2. Extract the *hsync_extension* folder somewhere

3. Open up the "Extensions" page in Google Chrome by clicking the extensions icon in the address bar and then clicking "Manage Extensions"

4. Turn on "Developer Mode" (the switch in the top right corner)

5. Click "Load unpacked" and select the *hsync_extension* folder you extracted. A new extension called "Hulu Synchronization" should appear in your extensions list.

## Usage

1. Open a Hulu video you want to sync with.

2. Make sure the extension is enabled by clicking the red "h" icon in the navigation bar. You should get a popup which confirms the extension is enabled. If the "h" icon isn't there, pin it to the navigation bar by clicking the extensions icon. Once you've enabled the extension, it should stay enabled, so you don't need to keep the "h" icon there forever if you want to keep the extension on.

3. Play/pause should be (more or less) synchronized across all devices that have hulu_sync enabled while they're playing videos. There's no "rooms" feature or anything, so if you don't want your Hulu videos to interfere with anyone else's (or vice versa), you should disable the extension.

4. Timestamp synchronization is not supported (and won't be until I learn a lot more about the Hulu video playback system).
