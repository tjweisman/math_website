I spend a lot of time playing ultimate frisbee. I've played three seasons with Moontower, a mixed club team here in Austin, TX. Previously I played for one year on TUFF, the University of Texas men's team, and for four years on SÃ¼perfly, the Yale college men's team.

I also co-organize (along with [Richard Wong](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/richard.wong/)) the math department IM ultimate team, SO(2). I wrote some [articles](frisbee) for the team on basic frisbee strategy.

Sometimes I also work on small programming projects. You can see a few of them on [my GitHub](https://github.com/tjweisman/).
