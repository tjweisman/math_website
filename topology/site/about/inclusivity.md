Inclusivity in the topology seminar
===================================

The topology seminar at the University of Texas at Austin is commited to supporting diversity in both topology and mathematics in general. Our seminar explicitly aims to increase the participation of [underrepresented groups in mathematics](https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsf19304/digest/introduction), including women, people with disabilities, and underrepresented minorities (Blacks or African Americans, Hispanics or Latinos, and American Indians or Alaska Natives); we believe that the ongoing failure to include these groups is an injustice which damages the entire mathematical community. For this reason, we are committed to hosting and hearing from a diverse array of speakers in our seminar, especially speakers belonging to underrepresented minority groups.

We are further dedicated to making our seminar a welcoming environment for all those interested in topology, regardless of age, race, gender, gender identity and expression, national or ethnic origin, religion and religious belief, marital status, parental status, body shape or size, sexual orientation, physical ability, socioeconomic status, employment status and any other aspect of diversity.
