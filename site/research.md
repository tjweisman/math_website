Broadly speaking, my research interests lie in geometric group theory and discrete subgroups of Lie groups. In particular I'm interested in convex cocompact group representations, and especially generalizations of convex cocompactness, such as Anosov representations.

Currently I'm interested in thinking about groups acting on properly convex domains in projective space, and thinking about ways to tell when such an action satisfies some notion of convex cocompactness.
