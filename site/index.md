About me
===========

I am a fourth-year mathematics PhD candidate at the University of Texas at Austin. Currently my research interests are in convex projective structures and geometric group theory. My PhD advisor is [Jeff Danciger](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/jdanciger/index.html).

I graduated with a bachelor's in mathematics from Yale University in 2016.

Recently (August 12-16, 2019), I led a weeklong [summer mini-course](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/richard.wong/Minicourses.html) on hyperbolic groups. Click [here](teaching/hyperbolic_smc.html) for the course webpage.
