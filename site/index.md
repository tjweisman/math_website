About me
===========

I am a fourth-year mathematics PhD candidate at the University of Texas at Austin. Currently my research interests are in convex projective structures and geometric group theory. My PhD advisor is [Jeff Danciger](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/jdanciger/index.html).

I graduated with a bachelor's in mathematics from Yale University in 2016.

From June 1 to June 5, I'm leading a [summer mini-course](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/SMC/) on boundaries of CAT(0) spaces and Gromov-hyperbolic spaces. Check back here soon for more info.
