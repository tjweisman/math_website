About me
===========

I am a fourth-year mathematics PhD candidate at the University of Texas at Austin. Currently my research interests are in convex projective structures and geometric group theory. My PhD advisor is [Jeff Danciger](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/jdanciger/index.html).

I graduated with a bachelor's in mathematics from Yale University in 2016.

This semester I'm a TA for M408C, Integral and Differential Calculus, taught by Professor [Stefania Patrizi](http://stepatrizi.altervista.org/).
