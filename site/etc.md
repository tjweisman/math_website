% Etc.

Outside of math, I spend a lot of time playing ultimate frisbee. I've played three seasons with Moontower, a mixed club team here in Austin, TX.

I also co-organize (along with [Richard Wong](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/richard.wong/)) the math department IM ultimate team, SO(2); [here](frisbee) you can see some articles I wrote for the team on basic frisbee strategy.

I somewhat regularly spend time working on little programming projects, a few of which you can see on [my GitHub](https://github.com/tjweisman/).
