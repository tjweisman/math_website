Summer minicourse: Boundaries of groups and spaces
==================================================

This is the homepage for the minicourse I'm teaching from June 1 - June 5, 2020. I'll be updating the tentative schedule as I plan the course this week. Exercises will also be posted here (eventually).

The main reference for the course will be Bridson and Haefliger's *Metric Spaces of Non-Positive Curvature.* I'll probably also refer to:

- Druţu and Kapovich, *Geometric Group Theory*
- Croke and Kleiner, [*Spaces with Nonpositive Curvature and their Ideal Boundaries*](https://www.math.upenn.edu/~ccroke/dvi-papers/leebcx.pdf)
- Paulin, *Un groupe hyperbolique est determiné par son bord*
- Bowditch, [*A Topological Characterization of Hyperbolic Groups*](https://www.ams.org/journals/jams/1998-11-03/S0894-0347-98-00264-1/S0894-0347-98-00264-1.pdf)
- Bowditch, [*Relatively Hyperbolic Groups*](https://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/~masgak/papers/bhb-relhyp.pdf)
- Yaman, *A Topological Characterization of Relatively Hyperbolic Groups*

## Tentative plan

### 6/1/20

Definition of CAT(0) spaces, the Cartan-Hadamard theorem, and the visual boundary of a CAT(0) space. The cone topology and the angle metric on the visual boundary.

### 6/2/20

Visibility of the boundary of a CAT(0) space and embedded flats. CAT(0) groups and the failure of quasi-isometry invariance. Time providing, the Tits metric and direct sum decompositions.

### 6/3/20 - 6/5/20

Boundaries of Gromov-hyperbolic groups and relatively hyperbolic groups. Metrizing the boundary. Quasi-isometry invariance and quasisymmetry. Convergence group actions on the boundary.
