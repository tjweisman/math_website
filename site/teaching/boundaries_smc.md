## Abstract

This course will be an investigation of various kinds of boundaries of spaces that sometimes show up when doing geometric group theory. We'll be focusing on CAT(0) spaces, hyperbolic groups, and relatively hyperbolic groups. We'll define each of these kinds of spaces/groups, and give (at least) one construction for a natural notion of "boundary at infinity" for each of them. The main goal of the course will be to explore the various kinds of structures and properties these boundaries can have, and how they interact with the properties of the space they bound. Specifically, we'll look at things like

- different topologies and metrics on the boundary
- quasi-symmetry (and maybe quasi-conformality)
- quasi-isometric invariance (and lack thereof)
- dynamics of group actions on the boundary
- limit sets and quasiconvex subgroups

This is a lot, so I emphatically do *not* expect to get through everything on this list.
