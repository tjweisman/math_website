% Hyperbolic groups SMC

Hyperbolic groups summer minicourse
===================================

This course took place in summer 2019, as part of a series of [summer mini-courses](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/SMC/2019/Minicourses.html) for graduate students organized by Richard Wong. It was an introductory five-day course on hyperbolic groups, intended to be accessible for people without much background in the subject. Max Riestenberg was a guest lecturer on Day 2.

For most of the course, we followed the book _Metric Spaces of Non-positive Curvature_, by Martin Bridson and André Haefliger. I also referred to _Geometric Group Theory_ by Cornelia Druţu and Michael Kapovich, as well as Brian Bowditch's paper [_Relatively Hyperbolic Groups_](https://homepages.warwick.ac.uk/~masgak/papers/bhb-relhyp.pdf).

Exercises: [Day 1](teaching/exercises_day1.pdf), [Day 2](teaching/exercises_day2.pdf) (Max), [Day 3](teaching/exercises_day3.pdf), [Day 4](teaching/exercises_day4.pdf), [Day 5](teaching/exercises_day5.pdf)

--------------------------------------------

## Schedule

### Day 1

Quasi-isometries, the Milnor-Svarc Lemma, and a definiton of hyperbolic metric spaces
