Hyperbolic groups summer minicourse
------------------------------------

This course took place in summer 2019, as part of a series of [summer mini-courses](https://web.ma.utexas.edu/users/richard.wong/Minicourses.html) for graduate students organized by Richard Wong. It was an introductory course on hyperbolic groups, intended for those with little to no background in the subject.

Exercises: [Day 1](teaching/exercises_day1.pdf), [Day 2](teaching/exercises_day2.pdf), [Day 3](teaching/exercises_day3.pdf), [Day 4](teaching/exercises_day4.pdf), [Day 5](teaching/exercises_day5.pdf)

--------------------------------------------

### Schedule

#### Day 1

Quasi-isometries, the Milnor-Svarc Lemma, and a definiton of hyperbolic metric spaces

#### Day 2 (led by Max Riestenberg)

The Morse Lemma and the local-to-global principle in hyperbolic metric spaces

#### Day 3

Definition of the boundary of a hyperbolic metric space. The topology on the boundary, and the dynamics of hyperbolic group actions on their boundaries

#### Day 4

Algorithmic properties of hyperbolic groups: the word and conjugacy problems, the geodesic automaton
