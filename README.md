UT math department website tools
=================================

This repository contains:

1. Tools for building static websites using a combination of [Python-Markdown](https://python-markdown.github.io/) and the [Mako templating engine](https://www.makotemplates.org/)

2. A script for uploading static websites to the UT math network using rsync

3. The Markdown/HTML source and resources for my own website and the UT Topology seminar website (which I also currently run).

The site builder script is not terribly robust or flexible. If you want to use this code yourself, you're welcome to, but you're also a little bit crazy.
